## Describe how i managed the state in my project

Firstly, I use useState() for storing my data that comes from an API. I also use useEffect() for fetching data from APIs. To render my datas, I use the array map method. In App.jsx, I use useState() twice, once to set 'credit' to state and once to set 'price' to state.
